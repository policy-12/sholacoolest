               <h1>A Poem About Life</h1>
               <p>The world we live<br>
                  Life so brief<br>
                  The journey undefined<br>
                  Everyday like an onion bulb<br>
                  The more you peal a layer<br>
                  The more we shed tears<br>
                  Other time its like a roller coaster<br>
                  Up there in the mountain today, down in the valley tomorrow<br>
                  Other time we live like an outcast<br>

                  Life serve everyone its own dishes<br>
                  Some meal so interesting, others so sour<br>
                  Many taste it with a bud dead<br>
                  No one have knowledge of his/her content<br>
                  we just get served<br>
                  Whatever life dishes out for you, please make it a moment<br>
                  to savor and be stronger while you breath<br>
                  <strong>Because no one is coming <em>out alive</em></strong><br></p>
